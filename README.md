# Remainder-Dart


I developed a simple reminder application using Flutter and Dart, designed to help users schedule daily activities like waking up, going to the gym, and attending meetings. The app features dropdown menus for selecting the day of the week, time, and activity. It includes a time picker widget for precise scheduling. Once the selected time arrives, the app plays a sound or chime to alert the user. I implemented logic to manage and trigger reminders accurately, ensuring a smooth user experience. The project was tested on both emulators and physical devices to ensure reliability.
